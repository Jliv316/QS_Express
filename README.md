Quantified Self
A calorie tracker project for the fourth module
Introduction

Pearson’s Law:

    “That which is measured improves. That which is measured and reported improves exponentially.” - Karl Pearson

Technology has enabled us to measure more, and shorten the period between measurement and reporting. Sensors are cheaper and smaller, computers are everywhere, and we can access data from anywhere. People who have recognized this, and applied it to themselves are part of a movement called “Quantified Self.”

You are going to build a simple calorie tracker.
Learning Goals

    Create a Rails API given specified endpoints and response formats.
    Create an Express API given specified endpoints and response formats.
    Create an API in a new language of the students choice given specified endpoints and response formats.
    Review and refactor code (in each of the three languages) so that it:
        is well organized
        clearly communicates intent
        utilizes abstraction to hide complexity
        breaks problems down into small methods/functions with a single responsibility

Requirements Overview

You will be creating an API in three separate languages that supports a front-end that users will utilize to track calories in meals that they eat.

Your requirements for the application are detailed in the cards you’re going to create on Pivotal Tracker.
Background: The Front End

The application that consumes your API will have two main layouts. A “foods” index page and a “diary” index page (as seen below).
Manage Foods

Main Diary

At a high level, users will be able to:

    CRUD foods
    Add a food to a meal
    Compare calories to goals (meal and total)
    View calorie calculations in diary
    Data persists across refreshes

Back End Features

During the three weeks of this project, you’ll get the opportunity to build an API in three interations. First, you’ll build it in Rails. Second, you’ll build it using Node, Express, and Knex. Lastly, you’ll use a wild card programming language.

    You’ll start each of your new backend repositories from scratch.
    You’ll need to accept your email invitation from Pivotal Tracker and use this as your Project Management tool.
    Create a Pivotal Tracker board and write stories for each of your endpoints.
    Add your assigned Technical Lead to your Pivotal Tracker and your repository.

You will need to build nine endpoints for each of the technologies you will be using. All endpoints will return the data as JSON.
