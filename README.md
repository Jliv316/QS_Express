Pearson’s Law:

    “That which is measured improves. That which is measured and reported improves exponentially.” - Karl Pearson

Technology has enabled us to measure more, and shorten the period between measurement and reporting. Sensors are cheaper and smaller, computers are everywhere, and we can access data from anywhere. People who have recognized this, and applied it to themselves are part of a movement called “Quantified Self.”


At a high level, users are able to:

    CRUD foods
    Add a food to a meal
    Compare calories to goals (meal and total)
    View calorie calculations in diary
    Data persists across refreshes
