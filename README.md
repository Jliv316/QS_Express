Quantified Self

Pearson’s Law:

    “That which is measured improves. That which is measured and reported improves exponentially.” - Karl Pearson

Technology has enabled us to measure more, and shorten the period between measurement and reporting. Sensors are cheaper and smaller, computers are everywhere, and we can access data from anywhere. People who have recognized this, and applied it to themselves are part of a movement called “Quantified Self.”

Back End Features

During the three weeks of this project, you’ll get the opportunity to build an API in three interations. First, you’ll build it in Rails. Second, you’ll build it using Node, Express, and Knex. Lastly, you’ll use a wild card programming language.

    You’ll start each of your new backend repositories from scratch.
    You’ll need to accept your email invitation from Pivotal Tracker and use this as your Project Management tool.
    Create a Pivotal Tracker board and write stories for each of your endpoints.
    Add your assigned Technical Lead to your Pivotal Tracker and your repository.

You will need to build nine endpoints for each of the technologies you will be using. All endpoints will return the data as JSON.
